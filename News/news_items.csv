First Batch of Fluorine-18 Produced in the PERL,"<p>After about a decade of planning and four years of building and testing, we have reached an important milestone towards radioligand and radiotracer production from our new radiochemistry facility (PERL): This month, the new cyclotron has produced the first batch of fluorine-18. As expected, the yields are much higher than those from the existing cyclotron.</p><p>While much work remains to be done ahead of the inspection by the regulators (MHRA) in November, this is an important milestone towards full validation and the first batch of radiotracer for injection into humans, planned for the end of January 2020.</p>",First_Batch_Cyclotron.png,TRUE,FALSE

First-in-man study with new radiotracer,"<p>Here at the PET Centre we have recently performed the first-in-man study of a new radiotracer, [<sup>18</sup>F]tetrafluoroborate, which was developed here within the Division to investigate thyroid and head and neck cancer. The tracer, which is the world's first <sup>18</sup>F labelled sodium/iodide symporter substrate and the first new tracer developed within the Division to reach clinical translation here, should improve detection of small metastases in thyroid and salivary cancer. A number of multidisciplinary teams including radiochemists, physicists, clinicians, imaging staff, nursing staff and researchers have worked together to make this complex study come to fruition.</p>",BF4.jpg,TRUE,FALSE
