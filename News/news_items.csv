Simultaneous PET-MR Course,"<p>We are running the 2018 edition of our successful PET-MR course on June 6th-8th at St Thomas' Hospital in Central London (opposite Houses of Parliament / ""Big Ben"")!</p><p>The first day will review either PET or MR theory separately for people with a background in the respective other modality. We will then cover the new simultaneous PET-MR scanners in terms of technology and applications. There will be lectures, scanner visits, interactive Active Learning sessions, industry perspective (by both GE & Siemens), workshops, and sessions on reading scans together with clinicians. The content of the course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles.</p><p> For more information and to register, click <a href=""https://www1.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/shortcourses/index/name/simultaneouspetmrscienceandpractice2018/keyword/medicine""target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>",PETMRCourse_small.jpg,TRUE,TRUE

First-in-man study with new radiotracer,"<p>Here at the PET Centre we have recently performed the first-in-man study of a new radiotracer, [<sup>18</sup>F]tetrafluoroborate, which was developed here within the Division to investigate thyroid and head and neck cancer. The tracer, which is the world's first <sup>18</sup>F labelled sodium/iodide symporter substrate and the first new tracer developed within the Division to reach clinical translation here, should improve detection of small metastases in thyroid and salivary cancer. A number of multidisciplinary teams including radiochemists, physicists, clinicians, imaging staff, nursing staff and researchers have worked together to make this complex study come to fruition.</p>",BF4.jpg,TRUE,FALSE
