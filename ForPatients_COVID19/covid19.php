          <p>
            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are having to make significant changes to our services which may require postponing of non-urgent appointments. However, the PET Centre remains open, and if you require a PET-CT scan we will do our utmost to ensure you get it.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we contact you ahead of your appointment, we will now enquire about symptoms of COVID-19. If you have symptoms, we will ask you to defer your appointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions about your upcoming PET-CT scan please contact us by email or telephone (see the <a href="../ContactUs/contact_us.php">Contact Us</a> page for details). Our phone lines may be busy and there may be a wait for your call to be answered.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions please visit our <a href="../ForPatients_PETCTFAQ/petct_faq.php">FAQ page</a>. If your query is not covered in the FAQs please <a href="../ContactUs/contact_us.php">Contact Us</a>.
