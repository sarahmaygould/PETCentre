            <h1>What We Do</h1>
    				<p>
    					The PET Imaging Centre is part of both  King&#39;s College London's Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine as well as Guy&#39;s and St Thomas&#39; NHS Foundation Trust. It is the leading clinical PET centre in the UK. Our work includes providing a clinical PET service for patients and carrying out clinically related research with collaborators from the Hospital, the Medical School and other institutions.
    				</p>

    				<h1>Clinical PET-CT and PET-MR Scanning</h1>
    				<p>
    					The Centre is the first in the UK to have a purpose designed scanning suite, refurbished in 2013,  with two state-of-the-art PET-CT scanners and a simultaneous PET-MR scanner, the second of its kind in the UK. We have a third PET-CT scanner in the Cancer Centre at Guy&#39;s. Currently over 6000 patients a year are scanned, the vast majority of these being whole body FDG oncology studies. Medical staff in the centre are experts in the field having produced many of the standards and guidelines for the use of PET that have been endorsed/adopted by the professional	societies including The Royal College of Radiologists and bodies such as NICE.
    				</p>

				<h1>Teaching and Training</h1>
				<p>
					The Centre runs regular training courses for physicians, radiologists, radiographers and scientists and, as part of the Medical School, contributes to undergraduate and postgraduate (MSc and PhD) teaching.

        </p>

				<h1>Research</a></h1>
				<p>
					The Centre is active in many areas of research, including the development and evaluation of new tracers, the development and assessment of new clinical PET indications, coordination of national and international cancer trials using PET-CT imaging and new PET technology and data analysis methods. Medical and scientific staff make regular contributions at major international conferences and to leading journals on imaging related topics.

            <h1>Scanning and Tracer Production Facilities</h1>
				    <p>
              Clinical and research scanning is carried out on two GE Discovery 710 PET-CT scanners, one Siemens Biograph mCT Flow PET-CT scanner and one Siemens Biograph mMR PET-MR scanner. Additional equipment includes various well counters and online sampling for complex quantitative dynamic studies, motion tracking devices, radiotherapy lasers and a comprehensive computer network for reporting, data analysis and	archiving.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also have an RDS 112 11.2 MeV cyclotron and radiochemistry laboratory with 6 hot-cells capable of producing a wide	range of tracers for clinical and research studies. All tracers are produced to GMP standards.
