Short Course: Simultaneous PET-MR: Science and Practice,"<p>This course takes place at St Thomas' Hospital in Central London (opposite Houses of Parliament / ""Big Ben"")!</p><p>The first day will review either PET or MR theory separately for people with a background in the respective other modality. We then cover the new simultaneous PET-MR scanners in terms of technology and applications. There are lectures, scanner visits, interactive Active Learning sessions, industry perspective (by both GE & Siemens), workshops, and sessions on reading scans together with clinicians. The content of the course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles.</p>",PETMRcourse_small.png,FALSE,Simultaneous_PET_MR_Flyer.pdf,FALSE,N/A,https://www1.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/shortcourses/index/name/simultaneouspetmrscienceandpractice2020/keyword/medicine,19/05/2021,TRUE,FALSE,June,FALSE,3,TRUE,mailto:teachingadmin-imaging@kcl.ac.uk?subject=Register%20interest%20-%20PET-MR%20May%202020%20Course%21
Short Course: PET Methodology,"<p>Molecular imaging is an established and relevant tool for diagnostic imaging, clinical research and drug development.</p><p>This three-day course is designed to deliver extensive practical and hands-on training on experimental design and PET data analysis. You will learn how to design, quantify and analyze a PET tracer study.</p><p>The course is appropriate for graduates of medicine, biological sciences, engineering, physics and mathematics.</p><p>We hope  to run the course in 2021.</p>",Methodology_small.png,FALSE,PET_Methodology_Flyer.pdf,FALSE,PET_Methodology_Programme_2020.pdf,https://www1.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/shortcourses/index/name/petmethodologymar2020/keyword/medicine,,TRUE,FALSE,March and October,FALSE,3,FALSE,mailto:teachingadmin-imaging@kcl.ac.uk?subject=Register%20interest%20-%20PET-METHODOLOGY
CT in Hybrid Imaging for MPEs,"<p>This course is designed for MPEs, aspiring MPEs and physicists working with CT in PET and Nuclear Medicine.
