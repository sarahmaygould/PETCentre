Short Course: PET Methodology,"<p>Molecular imaging is an established and relevant tool for diagnostic imaging, clinical research and drug development.</p><p>This three-day course is designed to deliver extensive practical and hands-on training on experimental design and PET data analysis. You will learn how to design, quantify and analyze a PET tracer study.</p><p>The course is appropriate for graduates of medicine, biological sciences, engineering, physics and mathematics.</p>",Methodology_small.png,PET_Methodology_Flyer.pdf,https://www1.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/shortcourses/index/name/petmethodologymar2019/keyword/medicine,04/03/2019,TRUE,FALSE,March and October,TRUE
Short Course: Neuroanatomy for Imagers,"<p>This one-day course has been designed for people working in imaging but with no neuroanatomical background.</p><p>It will be ideal for statisticians, physicists, chemists, radiographers, mathematicians, computer scientists, psychologists and research fellows/PhD students. Based upon 180 slides but of a highly interactive nature, the course aims to further imaging and neuroscience research by enhancing neuroanatomical knowledge among participants.</p>",Neuroanatomy_small.png,Neuroanatomy_for_Imagers_Flyer.pdf,https://www1.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/shortcourses/index/name/neuroanatomymarch2019/keyword/medicine,14/03/2019,TRUE,FALSE,March and November,TRUE

Short Course: Simultaneous PET-MR: Science and Practice,"<p>This course takes place at St Thomas' Hospital in Central London (opposite Houses of Parliament / ""Big Ben"")!</p><p>The first day will review either PET or MR theory separately for people with a background in the respective other modality. We then cover the new simultaneous PET-MR scanners in terms of technology and applications. There are lectures, scanner visits, interactive Active Learning sessions, industry perspective (by both GE & Siemens), workshops, and sessions on reading scans together with clinicians. The content of the course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles.</p>",PETMRcourse_small.png,None,None,19/06/2019,TRUE,FALSE,June,FALSE
