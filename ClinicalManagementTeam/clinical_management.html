            <h2>Professor of PET Imaging and NIHR Research Professor</h2>
            <p>
						Professor Barrington is a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Professor. Her research focuses on the use of PET-guided therapy to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment with fewer side-effects.
						</p>
						<p>
						She is imaging lead for several multicentre national and international clinical trials testing how chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be tailored using PET to evaluate an individual patient's risk and response in haematological malignancies and other cancers. She also works closely with Clinical Oncology colleagues developing advanced imaging for radiotherapy planning to maximise the benefits of modern radiotherapy techniques with the aim of translating these into the wider NHS.  Professor Barrington has a special interest in the standardisation of PET methods and is co-lead of the UK PET Research Network with Professor Marsden. The UK PET Core Lab is based at St Thomas&#39; Hospital.
