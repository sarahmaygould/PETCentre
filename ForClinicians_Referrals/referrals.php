        <h1>Referrals Procedure</h1>
        <p>
          Referrals must be made in writing, either on a PET Centre referral form (below, or available from the Centre) or by referral letter. The form or letter then needs to be sent or faxed to the PET Centre. Please note that all referrals should include the patient's full name, date of birth, address and telephone number and, if an NHS referral, please include the GP details. Private patient referrals should also indicate the payment method. The clinical reason for the scan request, relevant past medical history including surgical intervention, previous treatment and results of imaging examinations are also required.
        </p>
        <p>
          The administrative office for the Centre is also based at St Thomas' so please direct all referrals, enquiries and requests for reports to the St Thomas'office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patient appointments will be scheduled at the first available time, usually within 2 weeks for routine referrals or earlier if clinical need dictates. Patients appointments are generally confirmed in writing, along with an illustrated brochure describing the procedure. Scan visits take between 1-3 hours depending on the procedure and careful consideration is being given to patient comfort throughout using our new patient areas to full effect. The radiation dose received is very small due to the short half-life of the tracers, and roughly equal to that of a barium meal. The only contra-indication is pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For further information about the scanning procedure, please contact the Centre.

            <h1>Reporting</h1>
            <p>
              The scan report and a CD-ROM containing images to illustrate the report will be sent to the referring clinician, usually within 4-5 working days. Please note that it is not possible to provide hard copy of all of the data generated. In cases where hard copy is supplied, it is simply a representative sample of images to illustrate the report.
            </p>
            <p>
              Referring clinicians are welcome to come to the Centre to review the images on the computer workstation if required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Urgent results can usually be telephoned or faxed within 24 hours on request.
