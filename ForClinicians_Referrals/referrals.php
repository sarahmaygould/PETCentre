          Referring Patients to the PET Centre

          <p>
            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are having to make significant changes to our services which may require postponement of non-urgent appointments. However, the PET Centre remains open, and if you require a PET-CT scan for your patient we will do our utmost to ensure it is performed. Normally this will be for oncological pathways. Please note scanning is currently (27 March 2020) consolidated at the St Thomas’ site and we are currently unable to offer slots at Guy’s Cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be aware that when we contact patients ahead of their appointment, we will now enquire about symptoms of COVID-19. If patients have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, we will ask them to defer their appointment, and will offer them a new one once they have fully recovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are vetting all referrals. Some non-urgent appointments may be postponed without a future date being arranged at this stage. If we postpone your patient’s appointment, they will remain on our waiting list and we will contact them in due course. If we consider the PET scan may no longer be necessary, we will endeavour to contact you before cancelling outright.

        <h1>Clinician's Brochure</h1>

          A brief guide to PET and the services offered by the PET Imaging Centre at St Thomas' is now available. This brochure is targeted at referring clinicians and can either be downloaded directly from this site or a copy can be requested by contacting the	department.

        <h1>Referrals Procedure</h1>
        <p>
          Referrals must be made in writing, either on a PET Centre referral form (below, or available from the Centre) or by referral letter. The form or letter then needs to be sent or faxed to the PET Centre. Please note that all referrals should include the patient's full name, date of birth, address and telephone number and, if an NHS referral, please include the GP details. Private patient referrals should also indicate the payment method. The clinical reason for the scan request, relevant past medical history including surgical intervention, previous treatment and results of imaging examinations are also required.
        </p>
        <p>
          The administrative office for the Centre is also based at St Thomas' so please direct all referrals, enquiries and requests for reports to the St Thomas'office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patient appointments will be scheduled at the first available time, usually within 2 weeks for routine referrals or earlier if clinical need dictates. Appointments are generally confirmed in writing, along with an illustrated brochure describing the procedure. Scan visits take between 1-3 hours depending on the procedure and careful consideration is being given to patient comfort throughout using our new patient areas to full effect. The radiation dose received is very small due to the short half-life of the tracers, and roughly equal to that of a barium meal. The only contra-indication is pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For further information about the scanning procedure, please contact the Centre.

          <b>Please note that PET requests will only be accepted from UK based clinicians. The referrer is required to read and acknowledge the referrer's responsibilities under IR(ME)R 2017, as detailed on the referral form.</b>

            <h1>Reporting</h1>
            <p>
              The scan report and a CD-ROM containing images to illustrate the report will be sent to the referring clinician, usually within 4-5 working days. Please note that it is not possible to provide hard copy of all of the data generated. In cases where hard copy is supplied, it is simply a representative sample of images to illustrate the report.
            </p>
            <p>
              Referring clinicians are welcome to come to the Centre to review the images on the computer workstation if required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Urgent results can usually be telephoned or faxed within 24 hours on request.
